ValQ Collaborate offers storage, export, and collaborative features within ValQ Visual. These features help you take your planning workflow to the next level with many enterprise integration capabilities.
:::note
For any requirements not met by the public cloud, consider moving to a private cloud with a collaborative enterprise plan. You get better control over the underlying resources, and you can choose and own the infrastructure for your application.

:::tip
It is ideal to publish the report to Power BI Service for collaborating with other users. This is because any changes made to ValQ's Model and Plan tabs on Power BI Service would not get updated on the Desktop App.
:::

:::note
1. After a report is published to Power BI Service, republishing the report in the same name would replace the existing file. This means all the changes made to ValQ's Model and Plan tabs on Power BI Service would be erased and the model gets overwritten by the Desktop model version.
1. While on Power BI Service always save the ValQ model and save the Power BI report for other users to see your changes. Also, the report on Power BI needs to be refreshed (URL refresh) to see the changes made by others on ValQ.
